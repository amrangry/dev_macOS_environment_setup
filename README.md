  $ echo '#!/bin/bash\nopen -a Terminal "`pwd`"' > ~/terminal.sh && chmod +x ~/terminal.sh
```

# 3. Oh My Zsh
Supercharge your terminal with styles, plugins and features! Since Apple replaced Bash with Zsh in 2019 and it installs with a single shell command, this is a no-brainer. You can pick from a boatload of themes â€” or just use the default one like me, itâ€™s plenty good!

Basically if you ever saw someone using a fancy terminal, chances are that he was using Oh My Zsh.

Plugins are also a huge part of the Oh My Zsh ecosystem. My must haves are:

git for displaying what branch I'm on + if there are any changes
wd - shorthand for warp directory allows you to set up warp points in your file system and then jump to them from anywhere!
If nothing else, this will prettify your Terminal â€” and who doesnâ€™t want that?! Get Oh My Zsh now!



#### How to use macOS Recovery
https://support.apple.com/en-eg/HT204904


Command (âŒ˜)-R
Install the latest macOS that was installed on your Mac, without upgrading to a later version.*
Option-Command-R
Upgrade to the latest macOS that is compatible with your Mac.**
Shift-Option-Command-R
Requires macOS Sierra 10.12.4 or later	Install the macOS that came with your Mac, or the version closest to it that is still available. 

# The Quickest Way to Show/Hide Hidden Files
Since the release of macOS Sierra, when in Finder, it is now possible to use the shortcut:
```ruby
 CMD + SHIFT + .
```
# Terminal
```ruby
  pwd to print the current path
```

# Xcode Command-line Tools
```ruby
$ xcode-select --install
```

# Modify text files in Terminal
```ruby
* Open File for edit
 $ vi filepath
 
* Input mode

 press i to enter the insert mode 
 press q coomand 
 
* Ex mode
To get into it, press Esc and then : (the colon).
 The cursor will go to the bottom of the screen at a colon prompt.
 Write your file by entering :w 
 and quit by entering :q
 You can combine these to save and exit by entering :wq
 However, if you're finished with your file, it's generally more convenient to type Shift-z-z from command mode
 write 
 :wq!   --> write and quite 
 :q!   quite without saving 
```
